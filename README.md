# 2-Tap FIR Filter Circuit

## Project Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of a **2-Tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter** for signal processing applications. The filter is designed using **digital signal processing techniques** to achieve efficient signal processing with minimal power consumption..

## Objectives
-  To implement a simple digital filter with low complexity.
-  To achieve basic signal smoothing using past and current inputs.
-  To use Cadence Virtuoso for circuit implementation and testing.

## Results and Conclusion
The 2-Tap FIR filter was successfully designed and implemented in Cadence Virtuoso, demonstrating effective noise reduction and signal smoothing capabilities. The linear phase response makes it ideal for applications such as speech processing, biomedical signal enhancement, and digital communication systems.
